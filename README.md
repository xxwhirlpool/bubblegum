hi this is my new git repo for my blog bubblegum. i wrote this based on the rails first app guide and then i added stuff. it's a fucking mess i know

site to-do list
* make tags actually functional because i started adding them in prod like a fucking dumbass, got stuck, and never finished it because i was stuck and frustrated
* make the index design less shit
* make the post page less shit (i don't really care that much about this one but at least resize the text boxes that's annoying)
